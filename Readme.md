## About The Project

The **Movie Hub** is a semester project designed to provide users with a comprehensive platform for discovering, rating, and discussing movies. This application aims to enhance the movie-watching experience by offering a user-friendly interface where users can:

- Search for movies by title, genre, or release date etc..
- View detailed information about each movie, including ratings, reviews, and trailers.
- Rate and review movies, contributing to a community-driven database of opinions and recommendations.

Built with modern web technologies, the Movie Hub focuses on responsiveness and performance to ensure an enjoyable user experience across devices. This project not only showcases my skills in full-stack development but also demonstrates my passion for film and technology.
